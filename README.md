# PrecisionTuneFileDispatcher
"PrecisionTuneFileDispatcher" is where I throw my music files into a pit and let them figure out where they belong. It's a highly personal script thats tailored to sorts me audio mess into something resembling order.


### Config.py Setup
```
# Configuration for paths and other settings
PATH_TO_WATCH = ""  # Add your source folder path here
DESTINATION_FOLDER = # Add your final destination folder path here
NO_ARTIST_FOLDER = # Add your folder for files without meta data
FLAC_FOLDER = # Add your folder for .flac files to be converted
LOG_FILE_PATH = # Add path to log file
```
